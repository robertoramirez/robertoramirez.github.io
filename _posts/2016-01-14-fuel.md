I'm of those who believes that the opportunities are given once time in our lives, whatever the consequences, and if you get a second chance, you are very lucky. In that way was like I decided finish my current job which gave me a lot in the last five years and begin a challenge in the energetic industry. 

I've to say that I had doubts, even I have them, but as the people says "if you want to get different results, don't do the same". I hadn't desires to leave, but they contacted me and I took it.
